    /// Singleton[T]
    /// 
    /// This is a generic base class for creating Singleton MonoBehaviour instances in Unity.
    /// It ensures that only one instance of the class exists and provides global access to it through a static Instance property.
    /// 
    /// Features:
    /// - Enforces the Singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances.
    /// - Automatically assigns the instance if one exists in the scene.
    /// - Logs helpful messages if no instance is found or if duplicates exist.
    /// - Makes the Singleton persistent across scenes using DontDestroyOnLoad.
    /// 
    /// How to use:
    /// 1. Inherit from Singleton[T] in your MonoBehaviour class. Replace `T` with the name of your class.
    ///    Example: `public class PlayerManager : Singleton[PlayerManager] { }`
    /// 
    /// 2. Access the singleton instance using `YourClassName.Instance`. Example: `PlayerManager.Instance`.
    /// 
    /// 3. Ensure there is exactly one GameObject in your scene with the Singleton-derived component.
    ///    If multiple instances exist, duplicates will be automatically destroyed.
    /// 
    /// Notes:
    /// - This class only works with MonoBehaviour-derived classes.
    /// - Use `DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject)` to make the singleton persistent across scenes.
