TutorialIntro,first dialogue after yell,BUDDEE,basic1,Welcome to Friend Finders Online! The perfect MMO for building new friendships!
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,bothered,Or well that's the idea anyways..
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,sheepish,Let's be honest you probably noticed that the servers are mostly empty.
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,sniffle,Our security went on the fritz a while ago and since then most people left.
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,worried,Now we have bots infesting the dungeons and our last player is trapped! But..
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,basic2,Maybe you can help!
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,basic1,If you can find the last player then maybe we could wipe the servers clean and patch this!
TutorialIntro,,BUDDEE,gremlin,Come through this door to the east and I'll teach you to be a bot destroying machine!
,,,,
Tutorial1,first tutorial room,BUDDEE,basic1,Use <color=purple>[Left Click]</color> in the direction of enemies or obstacles to attack them!
Tutorial1,,BUDDEE,basic3,Your cursor can destroy enemies as well as pots and chests! Try these ones I set up for practice!
Tutorial1,,BUDDEE,basic1,The dungeons are on lockdown so you'll have to clear out any enemies before leaving a room.
Tutorial1,,BUDDEE,smug,And don't worry about getting attacked. I've wrangled these ones so they can't hurt you!
,,,,
Tutorial2,second tutorial room,BUDDEE,basic1,With <color=purple>[Right Click]</color> you can dash through the air damaging anything in your path!
Tutorial2,,BUDDEE,basic3,Here you'll need to use it to <b>clear the gap</b>. But watch out! You can only dash once before recharging!
,,,,
Tutorial3,third tutorial room,BUDDEE,basic3,Some flying enemies can hide across pits too wide to cross.
Tutorial3,,BUDDEE,basic1,Luckily you can use your <color=purple>[Left Click]</color> attack to reflect their attacks!
Tutorial3,,BUDDEE,basic2,One you've mastered this you'll know everything you need too!
Tutorial3,,BUDDEE,gremlin,Those bots won't know what hit em'!

Tutorial4,,BUDDEE,sheepish,Hopefully the old players won't mind..
Tutorial4,,BUDDEE,basic1,Just press <color=purple>[P]</color> to bring up some options and head out the north door when you're ready!

End,,BUDDEE,Pity,I lied okay? The devs have abandoned this game. They aren't going to fix the servers.
end,,BUDDEE,Crestfallen,I'm sorry. You're my friend and that was wrong.
End,,BUDDEE,worried,But look at this place! Someone has to fix it!
End,,BUDDEE,sheepish,No one wants to join an MMO with no players..
End,,BUDDEE,sniffle,And if the last server closes I won't have any more friends.
End,,BUDDEE,pity,But if I can keep a few players then maybe people will notice and want to rejoin!
End,,BUDDEE,speechless,. . .
End,,BUDDEE,worried,I need everyone back. And I can't risk you getting bored and leaving.
End,,BUDDEE,threatening,Sorry pal.
